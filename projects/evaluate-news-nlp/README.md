This repository is my personal implementation to complete the starter code given by Udacity to _all_ students. I used it for the purpose of learning and advancing my React language skills and fulfilling the project requirement for the Evaluate a News Article with Natural Language Processing project which is a part of the Advanced Front-End Web Development Nanodegree Program given by Udacity in collaboration with itida.
